# Sales Prediction App Masterplan

## 1. App Overview and Objectives

This application aims to solve inventory management and sales forecasting challenges for a door shop in Libya. The main objectives are:

- Predict future sales to optimize inventory levels
- Reduce instances of stock-outs and overstock situations
- Provide insights into sales trends for different door types

## 2. Target Audience

- Primary users: Production engineer and technical personnel
- Future users: Non-technical managers

## 3. Core Features and Functionality

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:
- Data input/import from existing spreadsheets
- Sales predictions (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Basic inventory tracking
- Simple visualization of predictions and current stock levels

### Future Expansion Possibilities:
- Inventory alerts
- Order recommendations
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- User role management for different access levels

## 4. High-level Technical Stack Recommendations

- Frontend: React.js (for a responsive and interactive web application)
- Backend: Python with Flask or FastAPI (for ease of implementing machine learning models)
- Database: PostgreSQL (for robust data management and complex queries)
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn or Prophet (for time series forecasting)
- Hosting: AWS or GCP (for scalability and advanced services)

## 5. Conceptual Data Model

- Doors
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Code (e.g., 100, 110, etc.)
  - Color (derived from first digit of code)
  - Pattern (derived from second digit of code)
  - Dimensions
  - Other relevant attributes

- Sales
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Door ID (Foreign Key)
  - Date
  - Quantity
  - Price

- Inventory
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Door ID (Foreign Key)
  - Quantity
  - Last Updated

- Orders
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Door ID (Foreign Key)
  - Order Date
  - Arrival Date
  - Quantity

## 6. User Interface Design Principles

- Clean and intuitive design
- Responsive layout (works on desktop and mobile devices)
- Clear data visualizations (line graphs, bar charts, heat maps, pie charts)
- Easy navigation between different predictions and reports
- Ability to toggle between simple and advanced views

## 7. Security Considerations

- Implement secure user authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regularly backup data
- Implement proper access controls for different user roles
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations

## 8. Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Development
1. Set up development environment and project structure
2. Implement data import functionality
3. Develop basic sales prediction model
4. Create simple UI for viewing predictions and current inventory
5. Set up basic data visualizations
6. Deploy MVP for testing

### Phase 2: Refinement and Additional Features
1. Refine prediction model based on user feedback
2. Implement more advanced data visualizations
3. Add inventory alerts feature
4. Develop order recommendations functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Scaling
1. Implement user role management
2. Develop advanced reporting and analytics features
3. Optimize application performance
4. Implement additional machine learning models for more accurate predictions

## 9. Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. Data Quality: Ensure robust data validation and cleaning processes
2. Prediction Accuracy: Continuously refine models and incorporate more variables as they become available
3. Scalability: Choose a flexible architecture and use cloud services that can scale with your needs
4. User Adoption: Provide user training and gather regular feedback for improvements

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities

- Integration with supplier systems for automated ordering
- Mobile app for on-the-go access to predictions and inventory data
- AI-powered chatbot for quick queries about inventory and sales trends
- Expansion to multiple store locations with centralized data management

This masterplan provides a high-level overview of the proposed sales prediction application. It serves as a starting point for development and can be adjusted as needed based on changing requirements or new insights during the development process.
